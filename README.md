# StoryEngine-CLI

## What is StoryEngine-CLI?

It is a command line tool designed to execute interactive stories within command line,
it can be considered as an interpreter of specific format stated in details by [Wiki][1].

## Goal

Our goal is to create a tool with which everyone with a little bit of knowledge
can create their own interactive stories and share them with others.

## Design

In StoryEngine-CLI format, dialogs are written in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files and
connected to each other via configuration files
of [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML#:~:text=Extensible%20Markup%20Language%20(XML)%20is,%2Dreadable%20and%20machine%2Dreadable.)
format. Each _JSON_ file represents dialog and each _XML_ file represents configuration file.

## Get Started

The full existing docs can be found in [Wiki][1], it will actively grow in sync with the project itself.
